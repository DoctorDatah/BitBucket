Head vs Main 
What is the head in master branch?
The term HEAD refers to the current commit you are viewing. By default, you'll view the tip of the master branch on a repository, unless the main branch of your repository has a different name. The tip of the master branch is the most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase.

The simple answer is that HEAD is a pointer/label to the most recent commit of the branch you are currently on. master is the default branch created when you initialized a git repository (e.g. git init ). You can delete the master branch (e.g. git branch -D master ).

@What Happens to the other branches if you delete the master branch?
